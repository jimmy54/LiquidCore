 Called when a node.js process is actively running.  This is the one and only opportunity
 to start running JavaScript in the process.  If the receiver returns from this method
 without executing asynchronous JS, the process will exit almost immediately afterward.
 This is the time to execute scripts.
 
 @note This method is called inside of the node.js process thread, so any JavaScript code called
 here is executed synchronously.
 
 @note In the event that an `LCProcessDelegate` is added by `-addDelegate:` after a
 process has already started, this method will be called immediately (in the process
 thread) if the process is still active.  Otherwise, `-onProcessExit:exitCode:` will be called.
 
 @note Clients must hold a reference to the context for as long as they want the process to
 remain active.  If the context is garbage collected, the process will be exited
 automatically in order to prevent misuse.
